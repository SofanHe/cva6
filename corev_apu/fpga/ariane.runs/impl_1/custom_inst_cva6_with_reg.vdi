INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
WARNING: [Timing 38-493] Port clk_i has one or several leaf clock pins in its transitive fanout without any clock buffer on the path and no clock reaching the clock pin(s). Vivado cannot infer the clock source when no clock buffer is found on the path to a leaf clock pin.
WARNING: [Timing 38-242] The property HD.CLK_SRC of clock port "clk_i" is not set. In out-of-context mode, this prevents timing estimation for clock delay/skew
Resolution: Set the HD.CLK_SRC property of the out-of-context port to the location of the clock buffer instance in the top-level design
